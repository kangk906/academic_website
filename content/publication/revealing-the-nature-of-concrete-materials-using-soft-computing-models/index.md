abstract: "The durability of materials has long been a hot topic in civil
  engineering. This paper used a new approach to foster current research in two
  aspects: identifying important properties of concrete and simulating the
  transport of chloride in concrete. Machine learning methods have proven to
  have remarkable abilities in approximating complex functions, which provides a
  potential tool for realizing the above ideas. This paper used deep neural
  networks to identify important parameters of concrete via datasets and
  simulate the transport process by integrating physical constraints into
  models. Results showed that physical constraints could be well combined with
  deep neural networks to accurately identify materialsâ€™ properties (relative
  error < 1%) and simulate the aggression of chloride. This study also
  demonstrated that machine learning models could be interpretable. In addition,
  this paper also explored the influence of time intervals of detection
  datasets, the size of datasets, and the noise in datasets (-5%~5%) on the
  convergence of identification. Results showed that short time intervals and
  big datasets can accelerate convergence. This method can resist the influence
  of noise in datasets. In addition, with exact physical constraints, this
  method can predict the performance of materials without the assistance of any
  dataset."
